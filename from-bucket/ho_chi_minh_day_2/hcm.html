        <h1>Ho Chi Minh Day 2</h1>
        <h3>Morning Exercise</h3>
        <p>We started off our second day in Ho Chi Minh with a little exercise at the park near our hotel.

        <h3>War Remnants Museum</h3>
        <p>After attempting to keep our arms in shape, we headed to the War Remnants Museum, 
            which documents what we know in the US as the Vietnam War.</p>
        <p>We hadn't eaten anything yet and had to take our malaria pills, so we went to the tourist-trap
            cafe outside the museum. The food looked good, but it wasn't all that great. Every other meal on
            our trip has been a success so far, though!</p>

        <p>Here we are at the museum! They had a bunch of old planes and helicopters outside, which was pretty cool.

        <p>The mood and message of the rest of the museum was much more somber, though. It was really
            interesting to get such a different perspective on the war than what is taught in US history classes.
        </p>
        <p>They had a guillotine that was used during the war on display, along with a lot
            of pictures and descriptions of war crimes that were committed in this war of "American
            aggression."</p>

        <h3>Afternoon Exploring</h3>
        <p>After the museum, we lightened our moods with a walk to the bright pink Ta Dinh Church.
        </p>

        <p>And after eating a not-so-tasty-banh mi before the museum, we decided to check out the banh mi
            stall that was featured in the Netflix <i>Street Food</i> show. We knew we had found the right place
            when we came across a bunch of people on motorbikes stopped in front of a small cart in an alley.
        </p>
        <p>The cart owner didn't speak English, but luckily one of the other customers helped us order and 
            pay. The banh mi we got here was delicious!
        </p>

        <p>After eating our banh mi, we visited the Ngọc Hoàng Pagoda. And we hung out with some giant catfish
            in the pond out front.

        <p>On our way out, we came across one of the many outdoor barbers in Ho Chi Minh. Dylan didn't want to cheat on his amazing
            hairstylist though.
        </p>
        <img src="haircut.jpg">
        <p>We ended our day with an amazing dinner at a restaurant recommended by Cam Ly, one of Dylan's relatives
            who we met in Sweden but is originally from here. It was a great rec! And we had to skål/cheers to 
            Kevin and Marie, who just got engaged back home!
