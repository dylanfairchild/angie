        <h1>Lisbon Day 4</h1>
        <h3>Posting in the Park</h3>
        <p>We decided to take a relaxed approach to our final day in Lisbon. The Eduardo VII park had come 
            up when we were researching things to see in Lisbon, but it wasn't very close to where we were staying 
            so we hadn't gotten around to seeing it yet. We remedied that by hopping on the metro with our Kindles 
            and computer in tow.
        </p>
        <p>We got off the metro at the Marquez de Pombal stop (he was an important Lisbon politician I think) 
            and checked out his monument in a giant roundabout.
        </p>

        <p>From there, we went to a bakery (also named after Pombal!) to pick up a coffee and some breakfast snacks 
            to eat in the park. Unfortunately, my ordering skills were not so good. When I pointed to delicious 
            salami filled pastries and asked for two, the person working behind the counter thought I wanted the 
            tuna filled empanadas that were right next to the salami ones. And I wasn't paying attention enough 
            to notice that he grabbed the wrong ones before we were in the park. Bravely, Dylan and I ate most 
            of our tuna breakfast. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't my idea of tasty either.
        </p>

        <p>We spent some time on a shady bench that we found near the front of the park before doing some 
            exploring. The park had cool, tree-covered stone paths along the sides and a big green center, complete 
            with a labyrinth of hedges.

        <p>And when we got to the top, we came upon a really big fountain and gardens named after the famous 
            fadist Amelia Rodrigues.

        <p>At the top of the park, we found a great shady bench overlooking the entire park. You could even see 
            the ocean beyond the park. I did a little more posting and Dylan finished his book.

        <h3>City Wandering and Dinner</h3>
        <p>Once the battery on my computer got really low, we decided to head back to our Alfama neighborhood.
            We did some more wandering through small streets, finding a very picturesque but rather scary 
            street with a ton of pidgeons sitting on a wire and balcony. 
        </p>
        <img src="pidgeonalley.jpg">
        <p>I had read online that the best way to see everything in Alfama was to just wander and it 
            has proven an effective strategy.
        </p>
        <p>At one point, we came across the Lisbon cathedral, which is pretty close to our apartment.
            We had walked by it a few times already, but this time it was open so we got to go inside.

        <p>To cap off our relaxing Lison day, we went to a cute little restaurant for a veritable Portuguese 
            feast. (This was our last night in Portugal after all.)  I ordered a tinto verde (or green wine which 
            Portugal is known for), caldo verde (a Portuguese collard green soup), and bacalhau a bras (a cod, 
            shredded potato, onion and egg caserrole-ish dish that is a Portuguese specialty.) Dylan 
            got a cod croquette and a steak that was served with proscuitto on top! Ultimately, I've 
            decided that Portuguese food is pretty weird, but it grows on you and can be quite good!
