        <h1>Railay Day 2</h1>
        <h3>Morning Exploring</h3>
        <p>Our main reason for coming to Railay Beach was rock climbing. Southern Thailand has a lot of 
            beautiful beaches, but Railay is <i>the</i> spot for rock climbing. We booked a guide 
            and gear for rock climbing for our first full day in Railay, but we had a couple hours before 
            we were scheduled to climb.
        </p>
        <p>We decided to use our extra time to do some more exploring around Railay. We 
            were really impressed with how pretty everything looked in the sunshine. Little did we know, this 
            was the last sun we would be seeing for quite some time...

        <p>Once the early afternoon rolled around, we met our guide, got our climbing gear, and headed to 
            a climbing spot.  The penninsula is full of climbing spots, but we went to one that we were told 
            had some shelter from the rain...since there was a high likelihood of impending rain.

        <p>Climbing outdoors on real rocks was way different than indoor climbing, but it was a lot of fun!
        </p>
        <p>We did a range of routes. Some were pretty short and easy, like this one.</p>
        <img src="starting_out_steph.jpg">
        <p>But we also did some super long (and scary!) routes. Here's Dylan on his successful climb to 
            the top of a 30m route. By the time he got to the top, you could barefuly 
            see him from the ground! (I only made it up about 2/3 of this one, but I was still happy with 
            how far I went).

        <p>As Dylan was finishing up this climb, it started raining and then pouring. We waited out the worst 
            of it under a cliff overhang, but eventually it became clear that if we wanted to do any more climbing 
            we were going to have to do it in the rain. Armed with plenty of chalk, we decided we would go for it.
            Here's me in the rain!

        <p>It of course started pouring again as we reached the end of our scheduled climbing time. So we ended up 
            walking into our hotel completely soaked for a second day in a row!
        </p>
        <p>We were really tired from our climbing, so we decided to check out our hotel restaurant, which had 
            some really cute lights hanging from the nearby trees. We ate 
            Hawaiian pizza with delicious, fresh pineapple for dinner and bananas flambe for dessert!
