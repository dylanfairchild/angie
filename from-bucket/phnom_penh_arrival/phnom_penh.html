        <h1>Siem Reap to Phnom Penh</h1>
        <h3>Water</h3>
        <p>Before talking about what we did today, we thought it was getting crazy how much water
            we were buying. It really adds up when you are out sweating all day and cannot drink
            from the tap. Here is a picture of all of the big 1.5L bottles we had gone through
            for the room.

        <h3>Bus Ride</h3>
        <p>To get from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh we decided to take a Giant Ibis bus. It went pretty
            smoothly and it was nice to dodge the airport for once when traveling.
        </p>

        <p>The bus had a couple pitstops where they let you out to stretch your legs or buy
            some food. Here is a picure from one of them, it is hard to see but there is actually
            a boat moving through a low river in the farmland. It looked pretty odd, since it looked
            like the boat was moving on land.
        </p>
        <p>Pretty much everywhere we went through on the bus was farmland, Cambodia is very rural.</p>

        <h3>Phnom Penh</h3>
        <p>Once we arrived in Phnom Penh, we checked into our hotel which had an infinity-edge
            rooftop pool! Super cool!

        <p>After checking out the pool, we went to "David's Homemade Noodles", which Steph
            had found on Trip Advisor. It was pretty cool because David was making the noodles
            right out front and you could watch as you were eating. The food was also excellent, some
            of the best noodles we have had. They also brought stuff so you could mix your own spice
            with garlic for your soup / dumplings etc.

        <p>They also served a Cambodian Whisky, which we decided to try. I assume it was served
            as a whisky and water, since that is what it tasted like and the serving size was about
            right for that. It tasted pretty standard otherwise.
