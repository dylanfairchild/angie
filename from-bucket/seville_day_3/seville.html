        <h1>Seville Day 3</h1>
        <h3>Day Trip to Cordoba</h3>
        <p>Having seen all of the sites of Seville, we decided to take a day trip to the nearby city of Cordoba
            that has a big mosque-turned-cathedral that I had learned about in my art history class in high school. On 
            the train ride over, we were thinking that the countryside in southern Spain doesn't look all that 
            different than California.
        </p>
        <img src="train.jpg">
        <p>From the train station, we walked through a park that had some cool statues and an old Roman 
            mausoleum. 
        </p>

        <p>Eventually, we came up to the old city walls and a big monument and fountain in front of the mosque.</p>

        <p>After this initial exploring and a very difficult search to find a quick, easy breakfast (we have 
            missed the bakeries that were cheap and on every corner in Portugal), we went into the mosque.
        </p>
        <p>The mosque is huge and beautiful! It's most well known for the red-striped arches inside. But there 
            was so much more to see in terms of architecture and artifacts than I was expecting. The combination 
            of the Islamic architecture and Christian iconography was really interesting to me. (As you can see 
            below, I took a lot of photos.)

        <p>Bonus points if you can find the hidden faces in the picture above. (I found it as I was staring at 
            the ceiling.)

        <p>The mosque even had a section named after San Clemente!</p>
        <img src="mosque7clemente.jpg">
        <p>At one point, the light coming in from the stained glass created rainbow lighting on a couple of 
            the pillars. I saw this as yet another great photo op!
        </p>
        <img src="mosque16.jpg">
        <p>After seeing all of the inside, we remembered to take a photo of the outside too.</p>
        <img src="outside1.jpg">
        <img src="outside2.jpg">
        <p>Just beyond the mosque was an old Roman bridge over a river. There was no shade, and it was 
            close to a 100 degrees, so it wasn't the most pleasant to walk across. But we did it!
        </p>

        <p>With plenty of time to kill before our train back to Seville, we decided to check out a craft 
            brewery tap room that Dylan had found on the map. It was a cute little place, and we found that the lady 
            pouring beers appreciated my Spanish-speaking efforts. We ended up trying all of their flagship 
            beers (and getting free chips!) before heading out. 
        </p>
        <img src="califa.jpg">
        <p>From the tap room, we ventured through a cute alley known for its flowers and saw some more Roman 
            ruins before coming to the Plaza de las 
            Correderas, which was pretty quiet and closed up. (We still find the 4-8pm siesta time where everything 
            is closed up a little strange and difficult for touristing.)

        <p>But we ended up finding that a food hall (kind of like a small version of the Packing House or 
            4th Street Market back home) that we had seen on the way from the train station was open. We 
            grabbed a bite to eat and did a little reading before catching the train back to Seville.
