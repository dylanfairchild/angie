        <h1>Travel Day!</h1>
        <h3>Ho Chi Minh City</h3>
        <p>After just two days in Hanoi, we departed for Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Saigon. It wasn't quite
            as hot and chaotic as Hanoi, which was a welcome relief at first. But we surprisingly found ourselves missing
            the chaos of Hanoi after a little bit.
        </p>
        <p>We spent our first day eating and drinking and exploring.
        </p>
        <p>We saw the "Avenger's Tower" building on our way to the Ben Thanh Market.</p>
        <img src="avenger_tower.jpg">
        <p>We were bombarded with lots of requests to buy stuff at the market, but we avoided any attempts at
            haggling.
        </p>
        <img src="market.jpg">
        <p>Near the market, we ate some pho at Pho 2000, which apparently Bill Clinton ate at. After the egg coffee in
            Hanoi, we decided that we were essentially on a presidential tour of Vietnam.
        </p>

        <p>Next, we went to check out the first craft brewery in Vietnam, Pasteur Street Brewing. The food
            and beer at this place were so good that we didn't mind that they charged US prices. We may have
            even returned to this place the next day...
        </p>

        <p>This was the view from the rooftop patio</p>

        <img src="pasteur_food.jpg">
        <p>From the brewery, we walked through the center of District 1 of Ho Chi Minh City, seeing some 
            of the main sites
        </p>
        <p>Like this statue of Ho Chi Minh</p>
        <img src="uncle_ho_statue.jpg">
        <p>And the Notre Dame Cathedral of Saigon</p>
        <img src="notre_dame.jpg">
        <p>And the old Post Office</p>
        <img src="post_office.jpg">
        <p>My favorite, though, was watching a super cute (and pretty fat) wiener dog run surprisingly
            fast around a banh mi cart
        </p>
        <img src="banh_mi_pupper.jpg">
        <p>Next, we tried another craft brewery, Bia Craft, that wasn't as good as Pasteur Street Brewing. But we got a
            great view of rush hour traffic from where we were sitting on the second floor.
        </p>
        <img src="bia_craft.jpg">

        <p>We were pretty tired and decided to head back to our hotel, but we explored the night market on
            our way.
        </p>
        <img src="night_food.jpg">
        <p>And we discovered that the "Backpacker's Street" that our hotel was on had turned into something
            resembling the Las Vegas strip on steriods after the sun went down. 
        </p>
        <img src="backpacker_street.jpg">
        <p>People were selling all kinds of crazy foods on the street, like these dried squids</p>
        <img src="dried_squid.jpg">
        <p>But we opted to buy some ice-cream filled "fish" from Circle K that we enjoyed back at our hotel instead. Yum!</p>
