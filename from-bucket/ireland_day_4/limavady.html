        <h3>The Minibus!</h3>
        <p>After our miserable Chiang Mai to Chiang Rai minibus experience, I had hoped to never 
            see or ride in a minibus again. But it turns out we rented one to drive around Ireland! The 
            stick shift + driving on the wrong side of the road + tiny Irish roads makes the minibus driving 
            a little precarious. But I would take Randy's mini bus driving over our Chiang Rai mini bus 
            experience any day!

        <p>We were en route to Limavady today, but we made plans to visit Suzy and Elin's cousin Spencer 
            in Belfast and then check out Bushmills Distillery and 
            Giant's Causeway on the way. We also saw lots and lots of sheep in pastures on the way.

        <p>Driving to Belfast was interesting because it is in Northern Ireland, which is still part of 
            the UK. All of a sudden, you started seeing the Union Jack instead of the Irish flag.

        <p>After lunch with Spencer and his wife, we headed to Bushmills Distillery. It's an enormous, working Distillery. We weren't allowed to take photos 
            during most of the tour because of the active machinery. But we got to see all of the distillery 
            and bottling, which I thought was really neat to see.

        <p>From Bushmills we headed to see Giant's Causeway which is an area along the coast where a giant 
            lake of lava cooled into hexagonal columns. I thought it was incredibly beautiful and loved the 
            opportunity to stretch my legs after eating and drinking our way through a lot of Ireland.

        <p>I had fun taking photos of everyone in the area with the most lava columns.</p>

        <p>But then we ventured further to hike up a cliff and walk through some beautiful countryside.</p>

        <p>After we had our fill of Giant's Causeway we drove to our "Glamping" site in Limavady.</p>

        <p>Here's a picture of one of the available toilets at the camp site. We all chose to use the 
            other indoor bathrooms that were available as well.

        <p>We went to a local grocery store to pick up some food for dinner. By the time we ate, it was dark 
            (the sun doesn't set until after 9pm here!) and we were super hungry! It was cold but we had a 
            good campfire and got to experience the Irish outdoors to the fullest!
