        <h1>Lisbon Day 2</h1>
        <h3>Onwards to Castelo de S. Jorge </h3>
        <p>We headed out of our apartment this morning with a plan of seeing some of the main sites 
            of Lisbon. The first big thing on our agenda was the S. Jorge castle. But we got to enjoy 
            seeing more of the quaint but quirky streets of Alfama and views of the city and Targus river. 
            We also saw the historic yellow trolley that goes through this part of Lisbon.

        <p>We also had a quick stop at Pastelaria Santo Antonio on the way to the castle. I had 
            read online that this bakery had recently won the designation of having the best natas 
            in all of Lisbon. (Pastel natas are little circular pastries filled with egg custard.) You can 
            find natas just about everywhere in Portugal and people eat them with a shot of 
            espresso for breakfast, mid-morning snack, late afternoon snack, and dessert. We got a small 
            box here and were not disappointed. Just about all natas are good, but these ones were <i>really</i> good.
        </p>

        <p>With tummies full of natas, we got our tickets to head into the castle. </p>
        <p>The castle itself was pretty impressive and the views of the city from the castle were great, too.
            The castle also had one particularly cool statue out front that Dylan really liked.

        <p>On one part of the castle grounds is an active archeological site that we got to see from a distance.
            (The castle is from around the 12th century, so there is a lot of history there!)
        </p>
        <img src="castle9.jpg">
       
        <p>The castle grounds are also home to a bunch of peacocks. The weirdest thing is that the peacocks 
            flew up to and then sat in really tall trees. I had no idea that peacocks hung out with pidgeons 
            in trees.

        <h3>Impromptu Walk to Belem</h3>
        <p>From the castle, we ventured to the Praca do Comercio which is a big plaza along the river. It seems 
            like a lot of the Lisbon sites open up to or are oriented toward the river. The plaza was quite impressive 
            and so too were the columns in the water out front. 
        </p>

        <p>We were in a walking and wandering mood, so we decided to venture out from the Praca do Comercio 
            along the river. We saw these cool painted rock stacks that I think were supposed to be Amalia 
            Rodrigues, the most famous Fado singer from Lisbon. 
        </p>
        <img src="comercio3.jpg">
        <p>We realized that we were heading in the direction of a museum that was doing a Bansky exhibit, 
            which Dylan had read about. So we decided to walk along the river to get there. We weren't familiar 
            with the paths, so we didn't always walk in the most scenic of areas, but we got there!
        </p>
        <p>The exhibit had a bunch of Banksy pieces from private collectors and information about his work. 
            Dylan and I both like his work, so we were really glad we got to check it out!
        </p>

        <p>After going through the exhibit, I checked the map and noticed that we had just crossed into an 
            area of Lisbon called Belem. We had talked about checking out the sites in Belem but we had 
        planned on figuring out how to take the bus there because of how far away it is from Alfama where we 
        are staying. But once we realized we were half way there, we decided - why not walk? </p>
        <p>Our feet were quite tired by the time we got to the main part of Belem, but we were rewarded with 
            some great sites! 
        </p>
        <p>First, we checked out the Jeronimos Monastery and Santa Maria Church, and then the Padr√£o dos Descobrimentos monument, which 
            was partially over the water.

        <p>We came across some exercise equipment in the park outside of the monastery and thought we could 
                do some much needed arm work to balance out all of our leg workouts from walking. Turns out that 
                the Portuguese make their public exercise machines way too easy though.

        <img src="belem3.jpg">
        <p>Lastly, we ended our walk at the Belem Tower - 8.5 km (or about 5.25 miles) from where we started.</p>
        <img src="tower1.jpg">
        <img src="tower2.jpg">
        <p>We bought some Soleros Exoticos, which are like passion fruit instead of orange flavoured 50/50 
            bars (so good!), to fuel our walk back. 
        </p>
        <img src="solero.jpg">
        <p>As we got close to our starting point in Alfama, we came across a big outdoor concert! 
            We were pretty tired and didn't stay too long, though.
        </p>
        <img src="concert.jpg">
        <p>Instead, we opted to try out a restaurant near our hotel. Continuing his tradition of 
            eating a burger everywhere we go, Dylan got a Portuguese hamburger and I got croquettes with 
            caramelized red onions. On 
            both our dishes, though, the potatoes ended up being the truly outstanding part of the meal.
