        <h1>En Route to Madrid</h1>
        <h3>Goodbye Parador</h3>
        <p>This morning we got to enjoy a super fancy breakfast at our Parador before checking out and 
            getting on the road. The breakfast had such a huge selection of food, it was crazy! They even 
            had fresh churros with chocolate for dipping. Yum!
        </p>

        <h3>Toledo</h3>
        <p>Our ultimate destination was Madrid, but we decided to make a slight detour to see 
            the city of Toledo, which was a major Spanish city in the Middle Ages. I had read online that 
            driving and parking in the actual walled city was pretty difficult, so we found a "free" parking 
            lot just outside the city walls and paid a guy standing out front a two euro tip to watch our 
            car. 
        </p>
        <p>Just outside the parking lot, we came across the ruins of a monastery from the 13th century, 
            which was pretty neat.
        </p>
        <img src="toledo1.jpg">
        <p>From the ruins, we headed to a nearby set of escalators that provide access to the center of the 
            city, which is located on the top of a very steep hill.
         As we rode up the escalators, we felt like we 
           were on our way up the escalators at Universal Studios. 
        </p>
        <img src="toledo2.jpg">
        <p>In a lot of ways, the city felt like the quintessential tourist destination. It was filled 
            with a ton of restaurants and shops selling all kinds of Middle Ages-themed souvenirs.
        </p>

        <p>Although we weren't interested in buying a bunch of knives, axes, or suits of armor, we 
            did enjoy some great views of the city and countryside below.
        </p>

        <p>We also had fun checking out the historic city gates, a nice park, and the city's main plaza 
            and cathedral.</p>

        <h3>Madrid</h3>
        <p>Once we had our fill of Toledo, we rode the escalators back down and got in our car to 
            head to the Madrid airport to turn in our rental car. We were very happy to say adios to 
            the Nissan Juke and continue the rest of our trip car-free.
        </p>
        <p>At the airport, we figured out how to buy metro tickets for Madrid's nice but very confusing 
            metro system and headed to our hotel.
        </p>
        <p>Our hotel is located in the arts/theatre area of the city and is themed as such. We 
            are staying on the "writer's floor" in the Cervantes room. The wall has a fun Don Quixote 
        design, which seemed quite fitting since we had driven through La Mancha and seen the windmills 
        not so long ago.  </p>
        <img src="madrid4.jpg">
        <p>After checking into our hotel, we walked to a well-rated paella restaurant that was slightly out of the 
            main touristy area near our hotel. We got a taste of some of the 
            impressive architecture (intermixed with quite a bit of construction) in the city
             on the way to dinner.
        </p>
        <img src="madrid1.jpg">
        <p>Our paella was really good and at the end of our meal, the chef brought out glasses 
                of Hierbas, which is a Spanish digestive, for us to try for free! It was kinda weird tasting 
                (Dylan thought it tasted like rosemary) but 
                fun to try. </p>
        <img src="madrid2.jpg">
        <p>We enjoyed seeing some of the buildings lit up on our way back to the hotel, and then called it a night.</p>
