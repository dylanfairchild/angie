        <h1>Glasgow Day 2</h1>
        <h3>Glasgow Green</h3>
        <p>Dylan and I heard bagpipes playing from our apartment in the morning, which just seemed too 
            perfect for our first full day in Scotland. We ventured out to the park next door and found - 
            lo and behold - 
            a group playing bagpipes.   
        </p>
        <img src="bagpipes.jpg">
        <p>We did some more exploring through the park. We eventually came to a beautiful building 
            called the People's Palace and a terracotta fountain that is supposedly the largest in the world.
        </p>

        <p>I really wanted to explore the Glasgow Cathedral and Necropolis, and Randy found that the 
            oldest brewery in Scotland, Tennents, was on the way. So we set off toward Tennents! 
        </p>
        <img src="beer1.jpg">
        <p>After having done quite a few brewery and whiskey tours (which pretty much explain how 
            to brew beer too), we decided to skip the full "Tennents Experience" tour and instead just 
            look through some of the rooms with the brewery's history on display. 
        </p>
       
        <p>We learned that the beer was well-known for a really long time for having pictures of women on the cans.
        </p>

        <p>We had their main draught beer, which was unpasteurized and came from these very tanks! </p>
        <p>Randy, Cole, and Elin also ordered some flights so we could taste their other beers. They 
            made a beer infused with whiskey barrel chips. They put the whiskey barrel in the beer, instead 
            of putting the beer in the barrel. It was really good!
        </p>

        <img src="beer4.jpg">
        <p>From the brewery, we walked the short way to the necropolis, which was a <i>very</i> big cemetery as its 
        name suggests. From one point, you could see a building in the distance that had the word paradise 
        written on it. Dylan thought it was pretty depressing. It seemed kinda post-apocalyptic to me.  </p>

        <img src="cem3.jpg">
        <img src="cem4.jpg">
        <p>We got some great views of the cathedral from the necropolis, but then we also checked out the inside.
        </p>

        <img src="statuecath.jpg">
        <p>From the cathedral, we started what turned out to be quite a long walk to a restaurant called 
            the Ox and Finch where Elin had made reservations for "linner." (The place is very popular and, as mentioned, 
            we are a gang of 7, so 3:15 was the only time available for a reservation.) </p>
            <p>It started raining at 
            one point during our walk and not everyone was prepared, so we ended up ducking into a bar to grab 
            a snack and drink on the way. It ended up working perfectly, because we walked up to the restaurant 
            right on time. I didn't get any photos so I can only report that the food was delicious! It was all 
            tapas-style, sharing plates. Some highlights were scallops with pork belly, pineapple, and a peanut satay 
            sauce and a lamb stuffed zucchini (or courgette as the Scots call it). 
        </p>
        <p>The restaurant was right by a park that was hosting a summer concert series. Echo and the Bunnymen 
            were playing that night. Suzy and Randy tried to get last minute tickets, but they didn't have 
            enough for our gang of 7.

        <img src="river.jpg">
        <p>We got to check out the park and listen to their sound check/warm up. Also, Cole took 
            some time to observe his growing food baby, and Suzy got up close and personal with one of the fountain 
            statues.

        <p>From the park, we headed in the direction of a bridge and historic crane along the river that 
            I had been wanting to see. As we were walking, though, I looked up at one point and noticed that 
            we were walking past a place called Lebowski's. Upon closer inspection of their menu out front, 
            we realized that they had a ton of white russian cocktails - one inspired by each character of 
            <i>The Big Lebowski,</i> which is Dylan's favorite movie. We decided we had to check this 
            place out!
        </p>
        <img src="lebowski1.jpg">
        <p>Unfortunately, Grayden wasn't allowed into the bar since he isn't 18 yet. There is an interesting 
            loophole here where you can be underage in a lot of bar/restaurants as long as you order and eat 
            a meal. Since we had recently eaten a big meal, he wasn't feeling a whole other dinner. 
        He, Randy, Suzy, and Elin went to a different place, leaving Cole, Dylan and I to debate which 
        drinks to order.   </p>
        <p>The first round was so delicious that we ended up getting another. They weren't very boozy, but 
            they tasted so good! Cole started with an absinthe white russian (The Nihilist) and then moved
            onto a passionfruit one (The Cab Driver).
        Dylan started with a chocolate milk white russian (The Walter) and then moved onto one made with
        scotch (The Smokey), which 
         was surprisingly good. I started with one made with Buckfast (The Gutter Ball), which is a 
         caffeinated fortified wine 
        that we had been seeing on the menu everwhere. My second drink (The Jackie Treehorn) was like a
        normal white russian, only with 
        peanutbutter!   </p>

        <p>Eventually, we did make it to our intended destination which was the Finnieston Crane and Clyde Arc. 
            The crane was built in the 1930s and is left up as a symbol of the city's industrial background. And the 
            arc is just part of a cool bridge.

        <p>From there, we took the river walk back to our place, enjoying the setting sun and some statues and murals 
            on the way.
