        <h1>Blarney Day 2</h1>
        <h3>Blarney Castle and Gardens</h3>
        <p>This morning we got up and walked the short distance from our hotel to the Blarney Castle and 
            Gardens so we could be there when it opened at 9am. Even the entrance sign had 
            pretty flowers, which gave me hope that the inside would be really nice. My hopes were met 
            and exceeded!
        </p>
       <img src="castle1.jpg">
        <p>A bus full of Italian tourists also showed up right at 9am. We ended up pretty much sprinting from 
            the entrance to get to the castle before they did. I still managed one quick shot of the front first,
            though.
        </p>
        <img src="castle2.jpg">
        <p>The first part of the castle that we came across was the dungeons. We went part way in, only 
            to see a narrow tunnel. Grayden went in first so we had him explore and see if 
            the tunnel opened up at all or went anywhere. The last thing I wanted was to crawl through a 
            narrow tunnel, only to be trapped in by a bus full of people. Grayden soon reported 
            back that the tunnel did not go anywhere. (Turns out that we would have also known this if we 
            had taken the time to read the sign out front...) 
        </p>

        <img src="dungeon3.jpg">
        
        <p>Next was the climb to the top of the castle! We passed a sign at one point that said it would be a 90 minute 
            wait in a queue to the top of a castle from that point and a little bit later one that marked a 60 minute wait. It was 
            like the signs for rides at Disneyland when they are really busy. The last thing that we wanted 
            was to be climbing up super tiny, windy castle staircases in a giant queue of people. So we increased 
            our speed and made it to the top of the castle before anyone from the tour bus!
        </p>
        <p>Here are some pictures from the top of the castle.</p>
        <img src="top1.jpg">

        <img src="top6.jpg">
        <img src="top7.jpg">
        <p>Turns out that the main reason why there can be huge lines for the top of the castle is because this 
            is where the famed Blarney Stone (that supposedly gives anyone who kisses it the "gift of the gab") is 
            located. I had read about kissing the stone and knew it was at the castle. But what I didn't know until I 
            got there is that the stone is in the side of the castle wall at the very top. And the way that you kiss 
            it is by laying down, leaning backwards, grabbing onto some metal bars, and pulling yourself upside down 
            toward the castle wall. There is a guy whose entire job is to supervise this ordeal for hundreds 
            of tourists, every day of the year except for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Crazy!
        </p>
        <p>Suzy got pics of us kissing the stone, which was really nice!</p>
        <img src="kiss1.jpg">
        <img src="kiss2.jpg">
        <p>With the most important and arduous part of our castle visit done, we took a more leisurely 
            pace for our descent. Below are pics of some of the nearby towers and a pic of us looking down a "murder hole" where hot oil could be 
            poured on people trying to invade the castle. And also a pic of Suzy posing in one of the tiny 
            windows for shooting arrows down from the castle.

        <p>From the castle, we first followed signs toward the "poison garden," which was a garden full 
            of plants that can be harmful to humans in any number of ways. Grayden got jailed for getting 
            too close...just kidding.
        </p>
        <img src="poison.jpg">
        <img src="graydenjail.jpg">
        <p>From there, we wandered through the grounds, first finding a beautiful house and then a 
            bunch of differently themed areas.

        <p>Like this place that Dylan dubbed Fern Gully.</p>

        <img src="fern4.jpg">
        <p>And a place where a witch had supposedly lived. Here Dylan and Grayden walked down the "wishing 
            steps" with their eyes closed, which is supposed to make a wish come true.
        </p>

        <p>This was the stone that looked like a witch's face.</p>
        <img src="witchface.jpg">
        <p>We found an opening in a rock in one of the cave structures here. We saw an incredible photo 
            opportunity and took advantage!

        <img src="witch3.jpg">
        <img src="witch4.jpg">
        <p>We then explored through a jungle and forest area before walking through a more conventional 
            garden area with flowers. I really loved the trees and flowers! I also noticed that one of 
        the trees had kokadama balls that I learned about from my mom!</p>

        <img src="flowerssteph.jpg">
        <p>We also came across another set of caves/tunnels. Apparently the tunnels originally went all 
            the way to two nearby towns. We explored a little ways before the spiders scared us off.

        <p>One of the other highlights of our Blarney gardens experience was some impromptu bouldering. The rocks 
            in the first picture are famous stacked ones, so not fit for climbing...only silly posing. But then we found 
            a good climbing rock. 
            Dylan scrambled up first, which was no small feat in his increasingly worn down crocs. Grayden followed.
            I, of course, had to stay down to take the picture.

        <p>At one point, the sun and blue sky really came through, so I got another couple pictures of the castle.
            I zoomed in so you can see where people lean back to kiss the blarney stone.

        <p>We spent quite a few hours at the castle and gardens, but by the time we finished we still had a lot of day left. So we regrouped 
            at the hotel and made plans to head out to explore a nearby brewery in Cork and the small 
            town of Kinsale. (Dylan and I got 
            a quick arm workout in first.)

        <h3>Franciscan Well Brewery</h3>
        <p>Our first stop was the Franciscan Well Brewery in Cork!</p>
        <img src="brew1.jpg">
        <img src="brew2.jpg">
        <p>The brewery had a really cute beer garden, great beer, and a super chill bartender. We got pizza 
            from the adjoining restaurant, hoping for Dough Bros-level delicious pizza. Unfortunately, 
            the pizza wasn't as good as Dough Bros, but pizza and beer is never bad.
        </p>
        <img src="brew3.jpg">
        <h3>Kinsale</h3>
        <p>From there, we went to Kinsale, which was on Elin's list of cute Irish towns to visit. 
            The town had a harbor and was quite picturesque. Unfortunately, it started raining pretty hard 
            soon after we got there. We went from pub to pub, looking for somewhere to wait out the worst 
            of it. Most places were packed because there was a big Gaelic football match on tv. But we 
            eventually found one that had space for us, and a good view of a tv. I had an Irish coffee that 
            was even better than the one I had the day before. It was so good Dylan ordered one too. (This 
            was his first full cup of coffee ever. He decided caffeine is weird.)

        <img src="town1.jpg">
        
        <img src="town3.jpg">
        <p>Eventually, the rain stopped and we got a little sunshine before we headed back to Blarney.</p>
        <img src="town4.jpg">
        <p>I don't have any photos to go with my last story of the day, but I figured it was still worth sharing.</p>
        <p>
            When we got back to Blarney, we had plans to check out the Chinese restaurant in town, only to pretty 
            much get laughed out the door when we asked for a table of 7. The other popular and well-rated 
            restaurants in town were also packed. So as a last resort, we walked into an Italian restaurant that 
            happened to have a ton of open seats. We were suspicious but ordered food anyways. Most of what we got was 
            impressively bad. If you can imagine eating Italian food that was made without any garlic or spices, you 
            should have a sense of what it tasted like. Randy and Dylan both considered pouring basalmic vinegar on 
            their pasta dishes, just to get a bit of some flavor. Suzy and I had both ordered the soup of the day, which 
            we were told was vegetable. What we got was an extremely watery broth that tasted vaguely like celery.
            It was served with what looked like store bought bread. Luckily I wasn't too hungry, so I mostly just 
            found it funny.
