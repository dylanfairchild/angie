        <h1>Lisbon to Seville</h1>
        <h3>Goodbye Lisbon</h3>
        <p>This morning, we packed our backpacks and ventured out towards the metro stop to take us to the airport. On the way, I snapped 
            a couple pictures of some of the Alfama murals that we passed.

        <p>Our journey to the airport was very easy and our flight on this small TAP plane to Seville, Spain 
            for the most part was good too. 
        </p>

        <p>Toward 
                the end, though, we had A LOT of turbulence. I was seriously eyeing the barf bag in the seat pocket 
                in front of me and even Dylan who is usually quite unshakeable started feeling queasy. I made it 
                through the flight without loosing my lunch and was thinking I was home free...only to get ushered 
                onto a hot bus with an incredibly unsmooth bus driver. Thankfully, I survived that too. And most 
                importantly, our bags survived the journey too!</p>
        <h3>Welcome to Seville, Spain</h3>
        <p>We took a city bus from the airport to the main touristy part of Seville. From the bus stop, we 
            walked in nearly 100 degree heat to our hotel. Luckily, our walk wasn't too long and was quite 
            scenic. We walked through 
            the Jardines de Murillo, which is one of the main parks in Seville. Here, we came across a monument 
            to Cristobal Colon, or Christopher Columbus as we know him in America.

        <p>We checked into our hotel and realized that we had a lot of day left. So we set out to see some of the 
            sites of Seville.
        </p>
        <p>First, we wandered through some scenic plazas until we got to the massive Seville Cathedral. (It's the largest Gothic 
            church in the world, and the third largest church overall in the world.) It was closed by this 
            point in the afternoon, but we got great views of the exterior.

        <p>Next, we walked by the Real Alcazar 
                which is an historic royal palace that also happened to be a filming site for some <i>Game of Thrones</i>
                scenes. We realized that it was open late, so we decided to get tickets and check it out.</p>
        <p>The palace was quite impressive! We could really see the Moorish influence in the architecture.

        <p>The palace had a cool (figuratively and literally) subterranean section with a pool of water, some 
            impressive paintings, and a lot of painted tiles, which I really liked.

        <p>We also got to explore the gardens. Quite confidently, we decided to enter a hedge maze, only 
            to have a bit of difficulty actually getting out. At one point, we saw a place where someone 
            had forced their way through a hedge, breaking a wooden pole. I thought I might get desperate 
            enough to do the same, but we made it out!

        <p>This was the other scary part of our garden adventuring. Dylan noticed the shell of a gross 
            looking bug on one of the trees. Yuck! Everything else was quite beautiful though!
        </p>
        <img src="gardens10.jpg">
        <p>We capped off our day with a really, really good tapas dinner at a restaurant near our hotel.
            (We had actually tried to get food here shortly after we landed around 5pm, but were told that their 
            kitchen was closed. This was our first introduction to the Spanish daily schedule, where 
            people eat lunch from 2-4pm and then dinner between 8 and 10pm and where restaurants don't 
            serve food in between. We have been operating on an eat whenever we are hungry schedule and tend 
            toward early dinners, so we have had to really change things up.)
        </p>
        <p>Ultimately, the food was worth the wait. Using my best Spanish, we ordered one of their tasting selection 
            of tapas and then a cheese cake (of sorts) with vino de naranja (an orange flavoured 
            fortified wine for which Seville is known) for dessert. It was delicious! We had grown found of Portuguese 
            food, but we were quickly reminded of that fact that Spanish food is actually outstanding.
