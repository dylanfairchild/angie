        <h1>Malham Arrival</h1>
        <h3>One of Britain's Top Pub Walks</h3>
        <p>We checked out of our hotel in York and headed to Malham, which is a small town just outside of 
            a slightly bigger town called Skipton in the Yorkshire Dales. Dylan had found Malham on a website that ranked the top 
            "pub walks" in Britain. One of the main places in Malham is a pub called the Lister Arms that 
            also has 23 guest rooms. There are a whole bunch of day walks that all start from the Yorkshire 
            Dales National Park center, which is just down the street from the pub.
        </p>
        <p>We checked into our room at the Lister Arms and started out on a walk!</p>

        <h3>Malham Cove</h3>
        <p>Initially, we followed some directions that we had found on a website. These directions took 
            us through a pasture. We said hi to some cows and eventually found ourselves walking up to 
            a river coming out of the tall limestone cliffs that make up Malham cove. 
            While enjoying the site, we soon realized that we had a problem. A very nice path, which was clearly the 
            path that we needed to be on to continue our walk, was on the opposite side of the river. 
        </p>

        <p>I considered going all the way back to our starting point so that we wouldn't end 
            up on the wrong side of the river. But that seemed lame. So instead, I took off my socks and shoes,
            rolled up my pants, and braved some very cold stream water to get to the other side. This was one of 
            the few times when I was jealous of Dylan's crocs.
        </p>
        <p>Once we were on the right side of the river, we started hiking up some rock steps that took us up 
            to the top of the cliffs and offered us some great views of the countryside below.
        </p>
        <img src="cove5.jpg">
       
        <p>At the top of the cliffs, we found ourselves on limestone rocks that had been worn down over many 
            many moons by glaciers and rainfall. They looked really cool and had deep fissures between them 
            with all kinds of plant life growing inside. This part of the hike seemed a lot like a non-coastal 
            version of Giant's Causeway in Ireland. I really liked it!

        <img src="cove8.jpg">
        <p>From the top of the cliffs, we started following markers through some more pastures to get 
                to Gorsdale Scar.</p>
        <img src="cove9.jpg">
        <h3>Gorsdale Scar</h3>
       
        <p>When we came across a parking lot and a nicely paved road into a valley between two big cliffs, we 
            knew we had made it to the right place!
        </p>

        <p>Here's Dylan inspecting the rocks for their climb-ability.</p>
        <img src="scar3.jpg">
        <p>At the end of this path, where the two cliffs meet, there is a big cascading waterfall! 
        </p>
        <img src="scar4.jpg">
        <p>We did a little scrambling together to get as far as we could on the right side of the waterfalls 
            without getting our shoes wet.
        </p>
        <img src="scar5.jpg">
        <img src="scar6.jpg">
        <p>I noticed the view when I looked back was beauitful too!</p>
        <img src="scar7.jpg">
        <p>Dylan, who didn't have to worry about wet shoes, braved some waterfall crossing to scramble up 
            most of the way up the left side. Here's my documentation of his journey!
        </p>

        <p>Eventually, we departed from the scar and continued our walk towards Janet's Foss.</p>

        <h3>Janet's Foss</h3>
        <p>Foss is an old Scandanavian word for "force," which was used to name waterfalls. And Janet was 
            the supposed fairy queen who lived behind the waterfall here, hence the name Janet's Foss. 
        </p>
        <p>The waterfall itself was pretty, but the trail from the waterfall took us through an 
            arguably even prettier forest walk along the river. 
        </p>

        <img src="foss6.jpg">
        <p>We saw big lily pads and tiny mushrooms and trees growing on top of big rocks.</p>

        <img src="foss8.jpg">
        <img src="foss9.jpg">
        <p>Eventually, the forest came to an end, and we found ourselves on another scenic path 
            through pastures that led us right back to Malham.

        <p>We celebrated the completion of our walk with a couple beers near the bar in the Lister 
            Arms before setting into a cozy nook next to the fireplace where we ate a delicious dinner. 
            We decided very quickly that we quite liked Malham and the Lister Arms!
