        <h1>Onwards to Bangkok!</h1>
        <h3>Leaving Phnom Penh</h3>
        <p>It was a little sad to leave our hotel with its amazing rooftop pool in Phnom Penh, but we were
            also ready to begin our travel day Bangkok.  So we said goodbye to Cambodia and hello to Thailand!
        </p>
        <p>I couldn't resist a photo with this excellent cut-out at the airport.</p>

        <p>Our flight to Bangkok was almost empty, so we got moved to the exit row. I was able to stretch
            my legs out completely straight to the seat front of me! It's been a veeerrrry
            long time since I've been able to do that on an airplane.

        <h3>Bangkok</h3>
        <p>After landing at the airport, we took a bus to Khao San Road, which is known as the backpackers' street in Bangkok.  From there it was a thirty minute walk along a river/canal to our hotel. Luckily, it was late afternoon by the time we did the walk, so it wasn't too hot.  And we got to see some cool sights on the way, like this elephant pillar statue and the Saranrom Palce.

        <p>After checking into the hotel and happily dropping off our backpacks, we ventured to a nearby restaurant that had some good reviews. The reviews were right! The restaurant had an amazing view of Wat Arun, the Temple of the Dawn, across the Chao Phraya River. And the food was as good or better than the view!
        </p>
        <p>This was my view of Wat Arun from the table.</p>

        <p>And here is Dylan with dinner. We both got dishes with huge prawns!</p>

        <p>Dylan discovered that he had an extra dinner companion. This cute cat sat by his foot almost the whole time.

        <p>After such a good dinner, we decided we had to get dessert, and we were not disappointed. We decided to avoid the more traditional Thai sticky rice and mango dessert option and go for a roasted banana with peanut butter creme and homemade rum raisin ice cream. It was so good!</p>

        <p>Definitely a great start to Thailand!</p>
