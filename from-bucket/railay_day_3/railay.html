        <h1>Railay Day 3</h1>
        <h3>Chillaxing in the Rain</h3>
        <p>It was a rainy morning in Railay, so we decided to take it easy (especially considering our 
            rock climbing the day before). We ended up at a bar next to the beach, chatting to a couple from 
            Ohio that were on their honeymoon for a couple hours. Then, the power ended up going out on the entire 
            penninsula for a few hours. We decided that was a good excuse to relax and enjoy our "reading nook" (as 
            Dylan dubbed it), which was the covered patio between our room and our personal entrance to the hotel pool.
            Since we were at the end of the hotel, we actually had a good view of the cliffs from the nook as well.

        <p>Eventually, the rained lightened up enough that Dylan and I decided we would do some adventuring to a 
            part of the island with a cave, dubbed officially as the "princess cave" but unofficially the "penis cave." 
        </p>
        <p>On the way to this famous cave, we walked through another cool cave area that had some vines and 
            even some boulders that seemed climb-able.

        <p>Here's me at our destination. You can see where it gets its unofficial name</p>

        <p>At the beach near said cave, we noticed an inlet to what looked like an area between a couple of the cliffs 
            that you could just barely get to without swimming. We decided to check it out and were really happy 
            we did! We found a lot more cool caves and great views.

        <p>We ended the day with a meal at what turned out to be our favorite restaurant in Railay. Yum!</p>
