        <h1>Edinburgh Day 2</h1>
        <h3>Calton Hill</h3>
        <p>We started our second day in Edinburgh by walking to Calton Hill, which has a bunch of cool buildings and 
            monuments as well as views of the city below. 
        </p>
        <p>Here's me doing a silly pose with a cannon in front of an observatory and a selfie with the view.</p>
        <img src="calton1.jpg">
        <img src="calton3.jpg">
        <p>And here is the Nelson Monument, which is supposed to look like a telescope. (After failing 
            to answer a question about Lord Nelson correctly in our impromptu pub-trivia effort in Ireland, we have 
            come across a ton of Lord Nelson stuff. It's like he is haunting us for missing the question.)
        </p>
        <img src="calton2.jpg">
        <p>Most notable on the hill is the giant National Monument, which was inspired by the Parthenon in 
            Greece. Since we will be seeing the real deal in a few weeks, we will be able to see who did the 
            Parthenon better - the Greeks or the Scots. My money is on the Greeks.
        </p>

        <h3>Lunch</h3>
        <p>From Calton Hill, we walked to one of the nearby locations of a local fast food-ish joint 
            called Oink that I had read about. Each Oink location in Edinburgh roasts an entire hog each 
            day (which they display in the window). And the only thing that they serve is pulled pork 
            from said hog, which you can either get in a box or on a bun with a couple different sauces 
            and fillings. Dylan got his in a box with onion and sage filling and apple sauce. I got the 
            "Oink" size bun (the larger size is called a Grunter, which I found really funny) with Haggis 
            filling and hot chili sauce. It doesn't look the best, but it was tasty!
        </p>

        <img src="lunch2.jpg">
        <p>We also walked right by a gelato place that looked too good to pass up, so we got one to share.</p>
        <img src="lunch3.jpg">
        <h3>St. Giles Cathedral and the Edinburgh Castle</h3>
        <p>After lunch, we walked back to the Royal Mile to see the inside of St. Giles Cathedral (this 
            is the one I had pictures of outside yesterday). 
        </p>
        <img src="giles1.jpg">
        <img src="giles2.jpg">
        <p>This is a picture of the roof in the "thistle" chapel in one part of the church. (On a side note, 
            we have seen a lot of thistle stuff, since thistle is the national flower of Scotland. But the best 
            is a chain of souvenir shops called "Thistle Do Nicely." As I have said earlier, I can really appreciate 
            a good pun.)
        </p>
        <img src="giles3.jpg">
        <p>From St. Giles, we headed further up the Royal Mile toward the castle. On the way, we came 
            across a bagpiper who was braving the wind and generous enough to pose with tourists passing by.
        </p>
        <img src="bagpipe.jpg">
        <p>Dylan and I decided not to go into the castle for the full tour, but we really liked exploring the 
            exterior, especially seeing how the walls were built onto/into the rock below.
        </p>
        <img src="castle1.jpg">
        <img src="castle2.jpg">
        <img src="castle3.jpg">
        
        <p>I got this picture of the castle a little while later in the day from a street below, but figured it 
            would go well here.
        </p>

        <h3>Steph's Self-Guided Harry Potter Tour</h3>
        <p>Next, Dylan graciously went along with me as I hunted for various sites in Edinburgh 
            that are associated with the Harry Potter books. The city offers guided Harry Potter tours, 
            but I didn't want to torture Dylan too much - even though he said we could go on one. So I found 
            a self-guided tour online and used that to explore...
        </p>
        <p>First, we explored the Writer's Museum, which actually didn't have any J.K. Rowling stuff on display 
            at the moment, but was still neat to see. We learned instead about Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote 
            <i>Treasure Island</i> and <i>Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i>. The museum is housed in 
            a building from the 1800s, which is quite historic in and of itself!
        </p>
        <img src="writersmuseum.jpg">
        <p>Next, we explored Victoria Street, which also dates back to the 1800s. According to a sign on the 
            street, it's Scotland's most photographed street and believed by some to be the inspiration for 
            Diagon Alley in the Harry Potter books. (An important side note is that J.K. Rowling was living 
            in Edinburgh when she wrote a lot of her books.)
        </p>
        <img src="victoria1.jpg">
        <p>From there, we ventured into the cemetery in Greyfriars Kirkyard to see the headstones that 
            likely inspired Rowling in naming some of her characters.
        </p>
        <p>Here's me with the marker for William McGonagal (like Professor McGonagal).</p>
        <img src="mcgonagall.jpg">
        <p>And here's me with the marker for Thomas Riddell and his family (like Tom Riddle aka Voldemort).
            The main reason why we were able to find this marker was that a tour guide in a robe with a wand was 
            standing in front of it. As we waited for her to be done with her spiel to take photos, we heard 
            her saying that each Halloweeen at midnight, a bunch of people show up dressed like Deatheaters 
            (Lord Voldemorts' followers in the book) and pretend to duel with their wands...which is pretty 
            crazy. 
        </p>
        <img src="riddle.jpg">
        <p>From the kirkyard, we could also see George Heriot's school, which is supposedly an inspiration 
            for Hogwarts!
        </p>
        <img src="school.jpg">
        <p>As we were leaving the cemetery and wrapping up my self-guided tour, we also came across 
            this creepy relief/sculpture that Dylan thought looked cool. 
        </p>
        <img src="graveskeleton.jpg">
        <p>Although it wasn't an intentional part of the tour, we also came across a guy dressed like Dobby
            at one point
        </p>
        <img src="dobby.jpg">
        <h3>Beer Crawl</h3>
        <p>We ended up finding ourselves near the University of Edinburgh, which had a beer garden set up 
            for the Fringe Festival. It looked very inviting so we decided to get a pint. Dylan got a Franciscan 
            Well beer (from Cork in Ireland, which we visited!) 
            and I got a passion fruit cider, which was delicious but also very, very sweet.
        </p>
        <img src="roundone2.jpg">
        <img src="roundone1.jpg">
        
        <p>From there, we headed back to the center of town to see some more festival festivities - like 
            this juggler and this silent dj group, which looked really silly but seemed to be having fun.
        </p>
        <img src="juggler.jpg">
        <img src="silentdj.jpg">
        <p>On the way, we unexpectedly came across the taproom of a craft brewery called Fierce Beer. 
            We got a chilli (yes that's how they spell it here) and lime sour, a "kit-kat" pale, and a coffee 
            vanilla porter to share. The beers were very interesting and tasty, and we liked their can/wall art 
            too!
        </p>
        <img src="fierce1.jpg">
        <img src="fierce2.jpg">
        <img src="fierce3.jpg">
        <p>After heading out of the Fierce bar, we came across a Wahaca, which I had seen in London and 
            noticed beaause the name is a phonetic spelling of Oaxaca. We decided to try it out since Mexican 
            food is one of the few types of food we haven't had (and had been missing) since we left CA.
        </p>
        
        <p>We got micheladas, guacamole, and one of their recommended small plates selections. The food 
            definitely didn't taste like authentic Oaxacan food, but it was very good and actually had some 
            heat to it - which is <u>extremely</u> rare in the UK.
        </p>
        <img src="dinner1.jpg">
        <img src="dinner2.jpg">
        
        <p>After dinner, we continued toward the center of the city. On our way, we came across this 
            Oor Wullie. Dylan's least favorite thing about all of the UK and Ireland is the number of 
            wasps that are often buzzing about when you try to eat and drink outside. It thus seemed fitting 
            to get his picture with this Oor Wullie.
        </p>
        <img src="beeoor.jpg">
        <p>Eventually, we made it to another awesome beer garden set up for the festival in the heart of the 
            city with a great view of the castle. We finished out our day of excess with a couple pints, people 
            watching and listening to live music until the fire works show started above the castle.
