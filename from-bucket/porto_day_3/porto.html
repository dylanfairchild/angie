        <h1>Porto Day 3</h1>
        <h3>An Introduction to Port!</h3>
        <p>After checking out some of the port cellars in person the day before and doing some research online,
             Dylan and I headed out from our hotel on a mission to learn all that we could about port...mostly 
             through tasting.
        </p>
        <p>On our way to the opposite side of the river, though, I couldn't resist getting a couple photos 
            of us and the city!
        </p>

        <p>There are a few port cellars right along the river, but there are also quite a few up the hill. 
            We decided to start by hiking up the hill to see about scheduling tours at the less accessible 
            cellars first. The walk was steep and construction-filled, but the pay off was worth it!
        </p>
        <img src="constructionwalk.jpg">
        <p>Our first stop of the day was Offley. This was our first Port tour and we knew very, very little 
            about it, which was strange because we are used to going on beer and whiskey tours (which we are 
            seasoned experts on).
        </p>

        <p>We quickly started picking up information about the different types of port - white, ruby, and 
            tawny (which is ruby port that is aged in barrels) - and about the Douro River valley, pictured below, which is located about 100 km 
            from Porto and is where all of the grapes for port are grown. (Port, like Champagne, is origin-
            specific. You can't make a true port anywhere else.)
        </p>
        <img src="offley5.jpg">
        <p>My favorite part of this tour ended up being the guide, who was probably a few years younger than 
            us and quite funny. She told us all about her love of drinking sweet, affordable port and the goal 
            of avoiding the not-so-sweet port hangover.
        </p>
        <p>She also told us about how companies had started making super fancy, one room hotels out of 
            the really big port containers, pictured below, that originally contained ruby port. She told us that they 
            charged "Cristiano Ronaldo prices" to stay in them, which could be much better spent on buying 
            Port to drink instead, but admitted that it was a really cool concept.
        </p>
        <img src="offley2.jpg">
        <p>Here, we also got to see some of the machinery that was traditionally used to make port, like this 
            machine that I think was designed to separate the skins from the grapes.
        </p>

        <p>After enjoying the tasting that was included at the end of our tour, we ventured a little 
            further up the hill to Taylor's. Here we had the option of doing an audioguide tour, but we 
            didn't want to tour overload ourselves, so we opted to instead pick out a few fancier 
            ports to try in their really nice gardens. One of our choices was their 30 year old tawny. 
            We decided that you really can taste a difference in the port as it ages. It is really smooth 
            and develops a nutty flavor that was quite unique.

        <p>As we enjoyed our port here, we were joined by this rooster who seemed quite at home in the gardens.</p>
        <img src="taylor3.jpg">
        <p>We had reservations for a tour of Croft, which was also on the hill, but that wasn't until 5pm. 
            With plenty of time, we decided to venture down the hill to check out Calem, which is one of the 
            bigger and most visited cellars right on the river. We booked a tour and grabbed a quick bite at 
            an indoor food hall/market nearby. (Right after we ordered, we noticed a bug crawling inside 
            the display case that our sandwiches had been pulled out of. Luckily, I still had Travelan in 
            my pack from Southeast Asia so we took one with our meal and ended up just fine! Our stomachs 
            have proven quite strong, all-in-all.)
        </p>
        <img src="lunchsnack.jpg">
        <p>The tour at Calem ended up being really informative. It was a huge tour (45 people instead of the 
            seven we had on our tour of Offley) but we learned a lot about vintage port (which is made from one grape 
            harvest rather than a blend) and got to see a lot 
            of really old port before tasting some good, but no-where-near-as-old port.

        <p>With our expertise growing, we continued our port touring extravaganza at Croft. This port 
            cellar is famous for making the first Rosé port in 2006 (I think) as a way to appeal to a 
            younger market. We were hot and a little sweaty from hiking back up the hill, so we were quite 
            happy to be offered a glass at the start of our tour. We learned that the Rose is their 
            only port that doesn't come into contact with French Oak. It is kept in stainless steel 
            containers, so that it has a lighter, more refreshing flavor that works well in cocktails.
        </p>
        <img src="croft1.jpg">
        <p>On this tour, we got to see some pictures of how Croft still makes some of their port in the 
            traditional way, complete with foot-smashed grapes. And of course, we ended with some more 
            port tasting.
        </p>

        <img src="croft4.jpg">
        <p>In great spirits from some great port, we ventured back down the hill, taking a little time 
            to get pictures of one of the murals and a silly sign that we had passed a few times in our 
            trekking up and down the hill earlier.
        </p>
        <img src="mural.jpg">
        <img src="funnysign.jpg">
        <p>Once back on the river, we weren't quite ready for the port tasting extravaganza to end, 
            especially when we saw an open table outside of Calem's bar, which is right along the river 
            walk. Here, we tasted Calem's sweetest white (a Lágrima which earns it's name from the "tears" 
            that it leaves on the sides of the glass), their Rosé, and their 30 year tawny. We decided that 
            Croft's Rosé was a little better and so was Taylor's 30 year tawny, but we were still quite content 
            with Calem's options.
        </p>

        <p>When I couldn't take any more sugar, we picked up and went to a casual restaurant next door 
            that also had a spot outside. We shared a franceisina and cod croquette (another Portuguese 
            speciality) while enjoying some people watching.
        </p>

        <p>As the sun was setting, we headed back to our hotel and came across another set of performers 
            in front of the Luis bridge. I was impressed from the beginning but was really impressed when 
            one of the performers stood on the other's shoulders and then swung a hoola hoop that was on fire 
            around her neck! Crazy!
