        <h1>Malham Day 2</h1>
        <h3>Breakfast</h3>
        <p>One of the many nice things about the Lister Arms is that breakfast is included! It had been 
            a while since we had had a big breakfast so we ordered the Yorkshire Grill, which is pretty 
            much a full English breakfast. It was quite tasty!
        </p>

        <h3>Pennine Way to the Malham Tarn</h3>
        <p>With plenty of fuel for the day, we started off on an approx. 7.5 mile walk along Pennine Way 
            to see the Malham Tarn. (We learned that a tarn is a mountain lake that is formed by glaciers.)
        </p>
        <p>This walk also started by taking you to and then up Malham cove. This time, we made sure that we 
            were on the nice, paved trail that didn't require any river crossing. Turns out that this trail 
            runs right along an old barn in Malham that we checked out. 
        </p>

        <p>As we approached the cove this time, we discovered that a bunch of cows had made the trail and 
            its surrounding area their hangout and nap spot.

        <p>After dodging some sleeping and awake cows, we spent a little more time checking out the cliffs 
            and the area where the water flows out of the ground below the cliffs at the start of the river.
        </p>

        <p>We noticed some climbing carabiners, so these cliffs clearly are a climbing spot - but all the routes 
            that we saw looked really hard.
        </p>
        <p>Feeling inspired, we did a little bouldering to get up a rock along the river. We got some pics 
            from the top and then climbed back down. I may have lost my balance coming down and fell onto my 
            butt. I bruised my elbow but "walked it off like a champ" according to Dylan.

        <p>After hiking the steps to the top of the cliffs once more, we followed a different set of markers 
            than the day before. These markers led us through sheep pastures, across rocky paths, and through 
            some more 
            cliffs.

        <p>Along this path, we also came across the Malham "sink," which is where a stream of water 
            flowing out of the tarn suddenly disappears into the ground - only to reappear later. 
        </p>
        <img src="tarn7sink.jpg">
        <p>Eventually, we came upon the tarn! We walked a little ways around the lake, which had some 
            pretty trees and cliffs surrounding it.

        <img src="tarn14.jpg">
        <p>For this walk, we returned the way we came, running into more cows and sheep and even some horses as we 
            enoyed the scenic views along the way.</p>

        <p>This picture doesn't look like all that much, but it does a good job of documenting how parts of our 
            walk seemed to involve just picking a random path through a bunch of rolling pastures. All we could do was 
            hope that we came across small wooden signs with markers assuring us that we were on the right track 
            every once in a while.
        </p>
        <img src="tarn8.jpg">
        <p>As we made it back into Malham, I also made sure to get a picture of the chicken coops in town 
            that provided the free range eggs that we enjoyed for breakfast. All in all, we saw a barn, 
            dozens of cows, dozens of sheep, two horses, and a handful of chickens today. We are hoping that 
            we don't get asked by airport security if we have visited any farms on our travels. Because it 
            seems like the Yorkshire Dales are one giant farm.

        <h3>Dinner</h3>
        <p>We ended the day once again with a great dinner in front of the fire in our pub/hotel. I 
            had really enjoyed the bangers and mash that I ordered the night before, and this night I got 
            their famed steak and ale pie. Yum!
