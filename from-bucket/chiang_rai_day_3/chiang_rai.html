        <h1>Chiang Rai Day 3</h1>
        <h3>Khun Korn Waterfall</h3>
        <p>For our last day in Chiang Rai, we decided to hire a Tuk Tuk driver for a day
            to take us out of the town to the Khun Korn waterfall hike and Singha Park.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, we didn't take any pictures with our driver, but it we were his first
            ride in his "brand new" Tuk Tuk he had bought the day before. He was 67, and needed
            a supplemental income for retirement since there is no sufficient pension or 401K
            in Thailand. He was a pretty nice guy, really excited for his new job. Unfortunately
            his Tuk Tuk did break down right after he dropped us off at the hotel, but hopefully
            he got that fixed and is back on the streets by now.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some pictures Steph took from the Tuk Tuk.</p>

        <p>Anyways, the hike to the waterfall was pretty cool. About 30 minutes out of
            Chiang Rai and the hike is through a jungly bamboo forest.

        <p>There were plenty of bugs, cool mushrooms, and things like that on the hike too.

        <p>The waterfall itself was really amazing, the spray keeps the area really cool and
            it is a pretty impressive waterfall. There is a little swimming hole at the bottom of
            it, but neither of us went in past our feet.

        <p>There was a little rock just a bit into the water, which had to be conquered.</p>

        <h3>Singha Park</h3>
        <p>After hiking back to the Tuk Tuk, we headed over to Singha Park. This is a public
            park owned by Singha brewery. We rented bikes to do part of the park via the
            bike path (the park is gigantic), but they also have a zipline, zoo, etc.
        </p>
        <p>First order of business was some pictures with the big Singha statue.</p>

        <p>Steph also wanted to pose with the cow statues, they looked friendly.</p>

        <p>Our helmets were pretty goofy, but we had fun.</p>

        <p>The views on the bike trail were pretty great. We rode around a lake and through
            a tea plantation.

        <p>Since it was still very, very hot, we cooled off after our bike tour with
            a couple Singha craft beers at their cafe.

        <h3>Burgers & Beer</h3>
        <p>It was becoming linner time and we worked up quite an appetite biking, so we
            decided to stop at Sanfran Burgers & Beer for some food. We were the only
            people there at the time, but the food was good. Chiang Rai seems to be the
            cheeseburger capital of Thailand.

        <p>After linner, we popped over to the tourist night market to see what kind of
            cool Thailand clothes we could find. Steph found a killer pair of pants (I am a
            little bit jealous).

        <p>We finished off the night with a 7-Eleven bounty in the hotel room.</p>
