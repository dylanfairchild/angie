        <h1>Siem Reap Day 4</h1>
        <h3>A Relax Day</h3>
        <p>Since we had been so busy for the last few days, and we were getting some requests for
            pictures from the moms and grandmoms, we decided to take a slow day to get the
            last set of posting done and relax by the pool.
        </p>
        <p>That started off with walking through the pouring rain to lunch, the rain never lasted too
            long (10-15 minutes per shower) but really came down hard when it was raining.

        <p>We eventually got to lunch for another Hawaiian Pizza!</p>

        <p>After we finished that up, we decided to hang out at the hostel rooftop pool.</p>

        <p>We ended up sitting up there and watching as the sun went down and the city started
            to come alive.

        <p>We walked back to Pub Street for dinner and ate at a restaurant there, not one of
            our favorite places since Steph got attacked by a bunch of big bugs that had come out
            after the rain multiple times throughout the meal. They kept smacking off of her face
            and falling on her, funnier for me than her.
