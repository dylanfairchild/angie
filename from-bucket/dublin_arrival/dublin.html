        <h1>Dublin Arrival</h1>
        <h3>Traveling</h3>
        <p>We checked out of our hotel in London and headed to Heathrow to begin our journey to Dublin where 
            we would meet up with Dylan's family. Our flight was delayed, but we made it!

        <h3>In Dublin!</h3>
        <p>We took a bus from the airport and then walked a ways to where we were staying. We came across 
            a cute church with some sketchy scaffolding on the way.

        <p>Elin had made a reservation at a really nice restaurant, so we headed out for dinner shortly 
            after we dropped off our bags and got settled.

        <p>Here's us at dinner! (Group shot compliments of Suzy's phone.)</p>

        <p>We did a litle exploring through the Temple Bar district after dinner. It was a Saturday night 
            and the town was really busy! Lots of people drinking and talking in and around bars. I was 
            really impressed with how cute some of the bars looked with their flower boxes and lights.
