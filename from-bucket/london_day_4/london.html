        <h1>London Day 4</h1>
        <h3>More London Exploring in the Heat!</h3>
        <p>Today was the hottest day in a heat wave that hit London while we were there. Compared to what 
            we had experienced in Southeast Asia, the heat didn't seem that crazy to us. But with temps 
            reaching 102 degrees, Londoners didn't quite know what to do with themselves. All of the trains 
            had scheduled delays to avoid overheating the tracks, so we decided to stay local again and check 
            out more of London.
        </p>
        <p>We started off with an English breakfast! I got the normal breakfast, and Dylan got 
            the big breakfast (which came with an extra sausage and hashbrown on top of the two bacons, 
            one sausage, two eggs, mushrooms, tomatoes, baked beans, and two pieces of toast that were in the normal 
            breakfast.) It was a ton of food and delicious!

        <p>What do you do when you have a super full stomach in 90+ degree weather? You decide to stand 
            in a crowd of people for an hour to watch the Changing of the Guard outside of Buckingham Palace 
            of course! I had really wanted to see the Changing of the Guard and Dylan was nice enough to endure 
            the heat and buckets of sweat with me.
        </p>
        <p>We started off at the edge of a crowd behind the gate, with just an ok view. But by the end, I had 
            managed to sneak up close for a better viewing spot!

        <p>A band played music during the ceremony. They started out with typical marching music, but then 
            switched it up. They played the Doctor Who theme song, "Take on Me" by A-ha, "Get Lucky"
            by Daft Punk, and then the theme songs from Austin Powers and Pirates of the Carribean.
        </p>
        <p>Next, we decided to go into Westminster Abbey. Although the museums were free in London, everything 
            else was really expensive. But we decided to pick the Westminster Abbey as the one site that was 
            worth paying for the entry.
        </p>
        <p>The outside of the building was beautiful and the inside was amazing too! (I didn't get many inside 
            photos since there were a lot of no-photo signs about.)

        <p>From Westminster Abbey, we went to the National Gallery, another free museum!</p>
        <img src="national_gallery.jpg">
        <p>I got to see one of my favorite British paintings, and Dylan got to pose with this silly horse 
            painting.

        <p>We also came across this really creepy painting.</p>
        <img src="creepy_painting.jpg">
        <p>After the National Gallery, we walked back through Leicester Square and saw a bunch of kids 
            playing in a fountain. Everyone seemed to be looking for a way to cool off!
        </p>

        <p>We ended up taking the Underground back to our hotel to pick up the computer and attempt 
            another round of posting-catch-up in a park. This time we went to Hyde Park. 
        </p>
        <p>The park was pretty and had a big lake where you could rent paddle-boats.</p>

        <p>After about an hour, we started hearing some thunder and seeing lightning. It wasn't long 
            before it started raining. The typical London weather had officially returned! Luckily, we were 
            able to stay pretty dry walking under big trees back to the Underground station.
        </p>
        <p>I had been meaning to visit the famed 9 and 3/4 platform of Kings Cross Station from Harry Potter since 
            it was right by our hotel, but we finally got around to it this afternoon. I didn't want to 
        wait in the long queue for the official photo, but Dylan helped me get a good photo from the side! </p>

        <p>We also got a photo with one of the many telephone booths.</p>

        <p>We had plans to end our day with some Indian food at a really highly-rated place near our hotel. 
            On our walk there, we found ourselves in a super hipster-looking area, complete with 
            seating along a canal, a really big water fountain for kids to play in, and a small live music venue.
            We had read online that the Kings Cross area where we were staying was becoming pretty gentrified, and 
            this was clear evidence of that!
        </p>
        <p>Unfortuantely, the restaurant we were planning on eating at had about a two hour long queue outside 
            of it. We were hungry and not that interested in spending so much time waiting, so we went with plan b 
            and ended up at a small restaurant called Piebury Corner that I had read about. It was really cute and 
            had great pies! The pie crust was amazing! We of course had to get savory pies and some sweet ones (apple 
            and banoffee). Yum!
