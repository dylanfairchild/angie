        <h1>Dublin Day 3</h1>
        <h3>Harry Potter Bathroom</h3>
        <p>I thought it would be fun to share some photos of the bathroom in the VRBO where we were staying 
            in Dublin. Elin fittingly described it as the Harry Potter bathroom since it is legitimately 
            underneath the staircase. And as you would expect for a bathroom underneath a staircase, it was 
            tiny. You can't even stand in the shower with your elbows out to the side! It made showering 
            quite the interesting experience!

        <h3>More Adventuring...and Drinking</h3>
        <p>After everyone had managed a shower in the Harry Potter bathroom, we headed out to the center 
            of Dublin with plans to check out the Teeling Distillery and Trinity College. On our way, we 
            got to see a lot of cool buildings and statues and the famous, super tall spire.

        <p>Eventually, we made it to Trinity College, which was beautiful!</p>

        <p>Trinity College houses the Book of Kells, which is an illuminated copy of the Gospels from 
            800AD. We weren't allowed to take photos of it, but it was amazing to see! And I did get to 
            take some photos of other old "pocket"-sized Bibles that were on display.
        </p>
        <img src="pocketbible.jpg">
        <p>We also got to explore and take photos of the library, which had a ton of really old books, busts 
            of famous Irishmen, and the oldest harp in Ireland!
        </p>

        <p>From Trinity College, most of us picked up some sandwhiches to go and ate in a nearby park. (A 
            seagull was clearly eyeing my sandwhich as I took this photo.) </p>

        <p>While we were doing this, Randy and Grayden met someone from the airport to get their bags 
            which had finally made it to Dublin! Yay!
        </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the rest of us went to check out St. Patrick's Cathedral which was nearby. It had a lot 
            of stained glass inside and was 
            beautiful inside. It also is the place where Jonathon Swift (who wrote Gulliver's Travels) is buried.

        <p>Afterwards, we met up with Grayden and Randy to tour the Teeling Distillery. Like Pearse Lyons,
            they actually do their distilling on-site in Dublin.

        <p>Here was our guide Naimh (prounced Nave, or Meev according to Dylan). We are learning that Gaelic is not spelled how it sounds!</p>
        <img src="tourtriangle.jpg">
        <p>We learned that one of the owners filled a barrel of Whiskey on each of his daughter's birthdays
            and named the barrels after them. On their 18th birthday, they will get a barrel full of 18 yr old Irish 
            Whiskey!

        <p>We got a whiskey tasting with our tour, but then also tried an amazing caramel cold brew cocktail 
            made with Teeling Whiskey. Yum!

        <p>I think the long day and whiskey tasting got to Randy, Cole, and Grayden at a certain point.</p>
        <img src="lounging.jpg">
        <p>From Teeling, we did a little more exploring, checking out the outside of Dublin castle. We also 
            came across a building that had scenes from Gulliver's Travels carved into it!

        <p>We finished off the day with a bit of bar hopping, based on the recommendations of the bartender 
            that we talked to at Pearse Lyons, the day before. The first place we went was really open with 
            a great atrium, and the second was like a circus tent indoors!

        <p>At Suzy's request, I also got some more photos of all of the beautiful flowers hanging in 
            front of restaurants. They really made the city of Dublin pretty!
