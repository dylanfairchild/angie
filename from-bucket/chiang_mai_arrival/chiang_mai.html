        <h1>Chiang Mai Arrival</h1>
        <h3>Goodbye Bangkok</h3>
        <p>We said goodbye to Bangkok with a nice breakfast at our hotel overlooking Wat Arun.

        <p>After breakfast, we went to the airport to begin the next leg of our journey to Chiang Mai 
            in Northern Thailand.</p>
        <p>Most of the day was taken up with travel, but we arrived in Chiang Mai and got settled in time for 
            an excellent dinner at a small restaurant owned and run by a mother and daughter. They had a lot of 
            the typical Northern Thai dishes, like Khao Soi, which is a weird but good pork/curry/coconut
            milk/noodle soup dish. It was not like anything I had eaten before. We also ordered the sausage that 
            is common in Norther Thailand and another pork dish that was a lot like Chile Colorado, only with Thai 
            spices instead of Mexican spices.
        </p>

        <p>After dinner, we ventured a little ways out of the main area of town to a night market. (The central part
            of Chiang Mai is all within one square with a wall and moat surrounding it.) 
        </p>
        <p>The Night Market area was really cute. We perused through some of the shops set up along the sidewalk
            and then ventured into an area with a bunch of food stalls set up around a sitting area with live music.
        </p>

        <P>It was here that we discovered that Thai people, or at least Thai musicians performing for tourists, 
            love the song <i>Country Roads</i> by John Denver. We sang along to this bands' rendition...and we have since heard the song 
            no less than half a dozen times from other musicians.
        </P>

        <p>At the Night Market, we came across this great sign explaining directions to the men's and women's 
            bathrooms.</p>

        <p>On our way back to the hotel, we also came across a statue that I really liked. Some statues 
            warrant a pose...
