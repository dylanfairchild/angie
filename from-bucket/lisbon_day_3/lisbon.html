        <h1>Lisbon Day 3</h1>
        <h3>Day Trip to Sintra</h3>
        <p>We decided to spend our third day in Lisbon on a day-trip to Sintra, which is only about a half 
            hour out of the city by train. We were a little nervous due to our previous struggles with Portuguese 
            trains, but the rail line to Sintra was much simpler and easier. We started from the Rossio Train 
            Station in Lisbon, which has cool horseshoe doors, and made it to Sintra with no hassles at all.

        <p>In Sintra, we decided to skip the most visited palace close to the train station and instead 
            walk a little ways to a different palace, the Quinta da Regaleira, which is most known for 
            its gardens. 
        </p>
        <p>We really enjoyed exploring here! There were all kinds of stone buildings, statues, and pretty trees.</p>

        <p>One of my favorites was a small, castle-like structure that we were allowed to climb into. 
            Dylan had fun tucking himself into a corner behind the stairs. He then took some photos of 
            me - first as the benevolent queen and then as the angry queen of the castle.

        <p>One of the main attractions on the grounds is a well that you enter through a doorway in some 
            rocks. You walk in a spiral down the sides until you get to the bottom that has a whole bunch 
            of tunnels that take you through grottos. The grotto water was very green and slimy, but still 
            really cool to explore. We were daring and took the step stone path across!

        <p>Here's me posing with a cork tree, which Portugal is quite known for, and Dylan demonstrating that 
            things are not made for tall people here.

        <p>At the very end, we also checked out the actual palace, but even then, we mostly liked the views 
            from outside the palace.
        </p>
        <img src="quinta19.jpg">
        <p>The other main thing that we wanted to see in Sintra was the Castelos dos Mouros, a Moorish 
            castle from the 10th century. We had read several travel blog posts that all said that trying 
            to walk from the main part of Sintra up the hill to the castle was a bad idea since it was so 
            steep and tiring. They suggested taking a bus instead. But Dylan and I aren't big fans of buses. And 
            our legs and feet have proven strong. So we decided to ignore the internet advice and take 
            the walking trail to the castle.
        </p>
        <p>We were really glad that we did! The walking trail was really nice and took us right next to 
            the most popular climbing spot in Portugal. Towards the end, we could see the castle in the 
            distance too, which was neat.

        <p>We ended up really liking the castle too. We had been happy with the Castle S. Jorge 
            the day before, but this castle ended up being even more impressive because it was so massive.
            There were inner and outer walls that were integrated into the hill and surrounding some 
            impressively large boulders.

        <p>The castle grounds also included the ruins of people's "houses" from centuries ago. They were 
            mostly holes in the ground.
        </p>
        <img src="castle4.jpg">
        <p>We walked along the walls to the highest point, and from there got a decent view of another 
            palace on the adjacent hill.

        <p>On our way back down from the castle, we stopped to take some pictures 
            with a chair carved into a tree stump and a cool stone throne bench!

        <p>Once our walk was complete, we enjoyed a nice lunch outside, overlooking the Sintra 
            palace below. We ended up siting next to a group of super hipsters who seemed to be 
            real or at least wannabe Instagram influencers. They were equal parts annoying and 
            hilarious to listen to as we ate.
        </p>

        <p>After our lunch, we took the train back to Lisbon and picked up some cheese, chorizo, 
            crackers, and beer from a local market and spent the evening relaxing in Alfama. Sadly, I did 
            not get any pictures of this. You'll just have to trust me that it was nice.
