        <h1>Seoul - Day 2</h1>
        <h3>Changdeokgung Palace</h3>
        <p>We started the day off with our first round of sink laundry. Fun stuff! 
        </p>
        <img src="laundry.jpg">
        <p>Next, we headed out to see the palace right by our hotel. Dylan even agreed to sign
            up for a tour so we could see the palace's secret garden! </p>
        <p>The tour begins!</p>

        <p>I really liked the painted eaves of the buildings!</p>

        <p>This is where they did farming demos.</p>

        <h3>Changgyeonggung Palace</h3>
        <p>Why visit one palace when you can visit two instead?
        </p>

        <h3>Bukchon Hanok Village</h3>
        <p>After our palace adventuring, we went to find an area of Seoul with a bunch of
            traditional houses. It wasn't easy to find, but after a few failed attempts, we ended
            up in the right place.</p>
        <p>We weren't dressed the part, but a bunch of people were dressed up in traditional clothes
            to take photos.

        <p>We found a place to sit and drink a much deserved craft beer after our morning of exploring.</p>

        <h3>Buddhist Temple and Cheonggyecheon River</h3>
        <p>After our beer, we headed further south in the city to visit a temple and then walk along 
            a man-made river through the middle of Seoul
        </p>

        <p>We sat for a while next to a bird trying to catch fish.
        </p>

        <h3>Dongdaemun Food Street</h3>
        <p>After many, many hours of not eating, we found our way to food!</p>
        <img src="dongdaemun_food_street.jpg">
        <p>We got some udon and bulgogi inside a restaurant first</p>
        <img src="dinner.jpg">
        <p>But we couldn't resist the street vendor selling fried chicken for dinner part 2. 
            We ordered "super spicy"...he tried twice to offer us mild instead...but we insisted. 
            It was super spicy!
        </p>
        <img src="spicy_chicken.jpg">
        <p>We came across some city wall remnants as we enjoyed/suffered our spicy chicken.
        </p>
        <img src="city_wall_hill.jpg">
        <p>According to my fitbit, we walked a total of 35,207 steps (15.09 miles) and 63 floors.
            Not bad for our first full day!
