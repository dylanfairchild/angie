        <h1>Islay Day 2</h1>
        <h3>Breakfast</h3>
        <p>We started our morning on a pretty tight schedule, since we needed to be on the other side of 
            Islay for our first whisky tour of the day by 9:45am. Still, Suzy and Elin wanted to make sure that 
            we didn't miss out on what the owner of our rental had described as the best "bacon rolls" on 
            the island and possibly in all of Scotland. So while the rest of us waited in the car, they ordered 
            a bunch of bacon rolls to go from the market right next to our rental. Turns out a bacon roll is just a pile of bacon served in a big puffy 
            dinner roll. (Side note: Canadian bacon should really be called British Commonwealth bacon because all 
            of the bacon that we have come across here is like Canadian bacon. It's much more ham-like than bacon. And 
            very tasty!)
        </p>
        <img src="market.jpg">
        <p>The bacon rolls were a lot for the tummy to handle on a windy road so early in the morning, but I 
            was very happy to have tried one.
        </p>
        <h3>Laphroaig Distillery</h3>
        <p>The first distillery that we visited was Laphroaig. When we were planning the trip, Elin offered 
            to treat everyone to a really nice tour at a distillery of our choosing. We chose Laphroaig
            for our fancy whisky experience! 
        </p>
        <img src="laphroaig1.jpg">
        <p>We started off with a pretty normal tour of the distillery. The distillery was currently in its brief 
            off-season when it doesn't run for three-weeks so all of the machinery can be repaired and the workers 
            can have their holiday time. It ended up being a plus in some ways, because we got to tour parts of the 
            distillery that you normally can't. 
        </p>
        <p>Here is a picture of our awkward but very entertaining tour guide making a big show of the 
            very technologically advanced process of transporting grains from one floor to the next. (It 
            gets shoveled into a hole in the ground.)
        </p>
        <img src="laph4.jpg">
        <p>And here's Dylan in the kiln (definitely not a usual stop on the tour). The barley gets 
            funneled into the room from a chute in the room and then a guy normally stands underneath with the giant 
            metal shield you can see in the picture. He uses the shield to deflect the barley across the room 
            before it gets smoked.
        </p>
        <img src="laph5.jpg">
        <p>We also got to see and touch some of the peat that is used to smoke the barley and give the scotch 
            its distinctive, "fiery punch to the throat" flavor. Islay is basically an island full of peat. According to the distillery's 
            estimates, they have a measly five thousand years of peat left on the island. So no need to worry 
            about Scotch being hard to come by anytime soon.
        </p>
        <img src="laph6.jpg">
        <img src="laph7.jpg">
        <p>We also got to see Laphroaig's "Magnificent Seven" stills. We have all become experts on 
            the different shapes and sizes of stills on this trip. One of my favorite parts of this section of 
            the tour was walking past a bunch of photos of famous people at the distillery. Laphroaig is 
            well-known as Prince Charles's favorite Scotch. He looks pretty stoked on the whole Scotch-making 
            process here.
        </p>

        <img src="laph11.jpg">
        <p>After the normal tour experience, we came to a really beautiful area overlooking the water. We got 
            some photos in before the next and best part of our tour, where we got to go into a warehouse 
            and taste three different barrel-aged Scotches, directly from the barrels.

        <img src="laph13.jpg">
        <img src="ware1.jpg">
        <p>Our guide used a giant valinch dubbed the Crucifix to get the whisky out of the barrel 
            for us to taste initially. He 
            also put on a side show, flipping bottles filled with very expensive Scotch. He was 
        very proud of the fact that he has made people nearly faint by tossing such nice Scotch about. </p>

        <img src="ware3.jpg">
        <img src="ware4.jpg">
        <p>After we tasted the three different cask-aged Scotches, we got to each choose our favorite and 
            bottle some to take home! 
        </p>
        
        <p>Here we are being master bottlers!</p>

        <img src="ware14.jpg">
        <p>And at the end, we recorded our bottles in a book and signed our names to document the process.</p>

        <img src="book3.jpg">
        <p>Or tour guide told us about how a couple of swans, Gary and Mrs. Gary, lived in the bay right 
            outside of the distillery. When we were done with our wharehouse experience, we saw them and 
            took advantage of the sunshine for some more photos.

        <p>After getting our fill of Laphroaig, we all got in the car to experience something new - our 
            very skilled, non-Scotch drinking designated driver Suzy! She did a great job of getting us 
            around Islay safely.

        <h3>Ardbeg Distillery</h3>
        <p>Our second stop of the day was the Ardbeg distillery which was nearby. This distillery had a really 
            nice cafe and did table tastings of whisky, so we opted to eat lunch and do the table tastings 
            instead of a tour. 
        </p>
        
        <p>At the cafe, I got a Scottish pie which was delicious although the shape of the mashed 
            potatoes was a little suspect. Dyan and I also got a langostine appetizer to share. 
                We ate most of the actual meat out of the langostines, but we weren't brave enough to 
                suck the eggs and juices out of the heads and abdomens. Elin was much more thorough in her langostine eating!</p>
        <img src="pie.jpg">
        <img src="lang1.jpg">
        <img src="lang2.jpg">
        <p>We got two flights of Scotch after eating lunch, and one of the distillery people explained 
            them all, so we would know what we were drinking. One of the flights included some really 
            high-end Scotches. Below is Dylan holding a taste of Scotch that costs upwards of $800 a bottle
            in the US!
        </p>
        <img src="ardtaste1.jpg">
        <img src="ardtaste2.jpg">
        <p>Post Scotch tasting, we ventured out to take more photos around the distillery. Suzy isn't a big 
            fan of the Scotch, but she has quite the eye for photo opportunity spots around distilleries. Here 
            are some of the highlights of our Ardbeg photos. The last one is one of my favorites. Cole and Dylan decided 
            that if they hid, maybe they would avoid having to be in more photos.

        <h3>Islay Ales and Bruichladdich Distillery</h3>
        <p>On our way back to our rental, we decided to make a quick stop at the brewery on the island, Islay 
            Ales. We talked to one of the owner/brewers and sampled some of their beers before returning to the 
            rental.
        </p>
        <img src="islaybeer.jpg">
        <p>Since this was Elin's last full day on the island before she had to head home, she wanted to 
            check out the Bruichladdich distillery which makes a gin as well as a Scotch. She, Suzy, and I 
            ventured 5 minutes down the street from our rental with the intention of a girl's gin drinking 
            adventure. Unfortunately, the distillery closes an hour early on Saturday, so we didn't have 
            time to do any tastings. Still, Suzy got an excellent photo op in, and we picked up a small bottle 
            of the gin to try back at our rental. 
        </p>
        <img src="bruchlaidich1.jpg">
        <img src="bruch2.jpg">
        
        <p>The gin is made with 22 botanicals that are foraged by a full-time forager on the island. Elin 
            did some foraging of her own on the walk back to our rental and in our food supply to add a couple 
            more ingredients to our gin and tonics. I wasn't brave enough to put any Elin-foraged rose petals 
            in mine, but I did love the orange peel that she added!
        </p>
        <img src="bruch3.jpg">
        <h3>Dinner</h3>
        <p>We ended our day with a nice dinner in Bowmore, which is one of the bigger towns on Islay. We got 
            a "haggis tower" to share, which ended up just being haggis on some mashed potatoes with gravy. 
            Turns out I actually like haggis! I was expecting something much scarier and grosser, but it just 
            tastes like a well-spiced meatloaf. 
        </p>
        <img src="dinnerview.jpg">
        <img src="haggis.jpg">
        <p>Another highlight from dinner were the scallops that Elin and Dylan ordered. They came with 
            all of the scallop bits still attached. We looked it up after they ate them. Turns out its a 
            sac of scallop gonads and intestines. Yum!
