        <h1>Travel Day to Hanoi, Vietnam</h1>
        <h3>Seoul Airport</h3>
        <p>We got up early to head to the Seoul airport. We had a bunch of extra won to spend, so we
            decided to get our fill of Korean food before we got on the flight to Hanoi.  Luckily our
            tummies didn't get <i>too</i> angry.

        <h3>Hanoi</h3>
        <p>After a five hour flight, we made it to Hanoi! We dropped our bags at the hotel and then ventured
            out to nearby Hoan Kiem lake.

        <p>And we visited the Temple of the Jade Mountain on the lake.</p>

        <p>On our way back from the hotel, we stopped by St. Joseph's Cathedral.</p>

        <p>And we got pho for dinner, of course! It was tasty...especially after we added some super spicy 
            red peppers for heat!</p>

        <p>After only a couple hours of the heat and chaotic streets of Hanoi, I was ready to call it 
            a day and head back to the hotel. We enjoyed the sunset from our awesome balcony!

        <p>Our step count for the day was 15,382...not bad for a travel day I think!</p>
