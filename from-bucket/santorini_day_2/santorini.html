        <h1>Santorini Day 2</h1>
        <h3>Hiking to Oia</h3>
        <p>One of the top recommended activities for Santorini is a hike/walk from the town of Fira to the town of 
            Oia, which is on the very north end of Santorini. As two people who love walking and have become seasoned 
            walkers in the last three months, Dylan and I were quite excited to do this walk, which is about seven 
            miles long. Norm and Cole (who hadn't gotten the best night sleep due to hard beds and rattling windows) 
            decided that they would just do the very first (and most scenic) part and then catch a bus the rest of the way. So we 
            split up with plans to reconnect in Oia around lunch.
        </p>
        <p>As expected, Dylan and I really enjoyed the walk, which is essentially a pedestrain path that takes you 
            through all of the really expensive, fancy resorts on the caldera side of the island. (The island originally 
            had a huge volcano in the center, and the current island formation is a result of a huge volcanic eruption.) So we got 
            great ocean and island views to our left and super fancy resort views to our right. 
        </p>

        <p>There were also quite a few cute churches along the way too. The Greek islands are all about small, cute 
            churches.

        <p>Eventually (about two-thirds of the way to Oia), we left the fancy resort area behind and came to a 
            more rocky and steep part of the walk that wasn't quite as nice as the first part. But we still got some good ocean 
            views.

        <p>And before too long, we were rewarded with views of Oia...and more nice resorts.</p>

        <p>The main part of Oia was jam-packed with tourists, but it hit all the marks of the really cute, Greek island 
            touristy town.  </p>
        <p>We walked through the town, past a bunch of shops, flower lined streets, and churches. Our ultimate goal 
            was to find the staircase down to Amoudi Bay, which Santorini Dave had noted as the best swim (although 
            not beach) spot on the island.

        <p>After some very slow manouvering through the crowds, we found the staircase! The staircase ended up 
            being a bit of a bummer. Not only was it a steep 200+ steps, but it also was covered in donkey poo. In 
            some places it 
            was nearly impossible to take a step that wasn't at least partially in donkey poo. The goal was to just 
            aim for the older looking donkey poo remnants rather than the fresh stuff. 
        </p>
        <p>About half way down, we got to see the culprits, and we learned that you can pay to ride the donkeys up the 
            staircase. We figured that all of the poo on the stairs only helps boost their business. Because trust me, 
            exerting yourself climbing up a steep staircase covered in poo is not fun.

        <p>In the end, though, we felt that the poo navigation was worth it when we made it to the bay which is small but 
            really nice. 
        </p>
        <p>Dylan and I spent a little time scoping everything out before getting a table at one of the restaurants to get 
            some drinks and snacks while we waited for Norm and Cole.  </p>

        <p>We ended up not having to wait very long 
                at all for them. They showed up soon after we sat down and joined us for some grilled octopus (that was sooo 
                good) and spicy cheese dip. They also got a crayfish orzo to share.</p>

        <p>After eating, we headed to the swim spot and got to see some octopus being grilled up on the way.  </p>
        <img src="o13half.jpg">
        <p>We all really ended up liking the swim spot. We found a less crowded area of rocks where we could sit and 
            soak up some sun when we weren't swimming in the crystal clear water.

        <p>Cole also wanted to make sure that I documented Norm being Norm...</p>
        <img src="o20.jpg">
        <p>After a few hours, we decided to head back. We said goodbye to the beautiful bay and braved the donkey 
            poo stairs on foot. Dylan and I considered walking back to our apartment, doing the reverse 
            of our walk this morning, but we ultimately couldn't resist 
            sharing a taxi with Norm and Cole who didn't want to deal with the bus again or walk all the way back. 
        </p>

        <p>With the time we saved by taking a taxi, we were able to make it back to our apartment and head to 
             a nearby restaurant in time to enjoy the sunset. Our dinner ended up being really nice (it was a 
             "treat yourself" sort of meal) and the views were beautiful. (I took some pics of the sunset from the table 
             but I also embraced my tourist role and got up to take a couple pics from the restaurant's patio 
             entrance as well.)

        <p>For his main course, Dylan ordered the freshly caught red snapper, which was cooked and presented whole. The waiter opened 
            it up and removed all of the bones at the table, which was pretty cool to watch. He left the creepy looking 
            head though...

        <p>While we were eating, we saw another table get an amazing-looking dessert platter. We couldn't resist 
            ordering one for ourselves. It was a sugar rush overload, especially when combined 
        with the complimentary liqueur that we were served at the end of the meal, but it was a fun way to cap off 
        a great meal and vacation day.  </p>
