        <h1>Cuenca</h1>
        <p>Today we departed Granada and started a very long drive that included some more tunnels and cool 
            cliffs to a small town called Cuenca not too far 
            from Madrid in the middle of Spain.
        </p>

        <p>Cuenca isn't a huge tourist destination point, but we came across it in our trip planning as 
            a place in Spain with a Parador. Paradores are state-run luxury hotels located in converted 
            historic buildings. They are a way for Spain to promote tourism and keep old buildings really 
            nice.
        </p>
        <p>One of Dylan's colleagues had told him about them, and we decided that we should spend at least 
            one night in a Parador during our time in Spain. We considered a couple that were way out of 
            our price range in more popular destinations like Granada and one housed in a castle in the 
            middle of nowhere, before landing on the Cuenca Parador, which was affordable but still located 
            in a city with cool things to see. 
        </p>
        <p>Once we got to Cuenca (and survived a decently miserable parking 
            experience after doing a 20 point turn on a narrow street at the top of a really steep hill), 
            we decided we were quite happy with our choice! Here are some 
            pics of our hotel and room. (This Parador is a converted 16th century monastery!)

        <p>From our room, we got an amazing view across the gorge that Cuenca is built on, as well 
            as the "casas colgadas" or hanging houses that the town is known for.
        </p>
        <img src="parador3.jpg">
        <p>After checking into our super cool room, we decided to venture across the pretty sketchy, 
            bridge that was built in the early 1900s to see the main part of the town. Even though I wasn't 
            keen on spending too much time on the bridge, I did pause to take a few photos and appreciate 
            the view!

        <p>One of the casas colgadas has been converted into a free modern art museum. We weren't too 
            interested in the art here, but we took the chance to see the views from the casa of the gorge.

        <img src="explore4.jpg">
        <p>Next, we braved some scorching sun to wander through the streets of Cuenca and see some 
            statues and the town's 
            cathedral before heading up to a viewpoint near some very ruin-y 
            castle ruins.

        <p>We discovered that there are all kinds of hiking trails through and around the gorge, which 
            is beautiful. We wished that we had a little more time in Cuenca to actually explore some of 
            the trails, but we were happy that we at least got to see them from a distance!

        <p>After enjoying the view point, we did a little more exploring through Cuenca's cute streets and plazas.</p>

        <p>Having seen all of the main sites of Cuenca, Dylan and I decided it was time to give in to 
            our very hungry tummies. It was around 5 o'clock, and we hadn't eaten much all day. We stopped 
            at a gas station on our way up from Granada, and I bought a boxed sandwich that was not anywhere 
            near as good as the ones in London. Dylan didn't even want to attempt to eat a gas station sandwich 
            so he just got some chips and jam cookies (that ended up not being very good.) 
        </p>
        <p>We had a great plan to buy some local cheeses and meats with bread or crackers to have a 
            picnic dinner of sorts in our super nice hotel room overlooking the gorge. Unfortunately, our 
            plan did not jive with the way things are done in the super tiny Spanish town of Cuenca. There 
            was not a single grocery store within walking distance of where we were. We found a couple mini-mart-ish 
            places on the map, but they turned out to be tchotchke shops with some food items packaged as 
            souvenirs or tiny shops with mostly just packaged junk food.
        </p>
        <p>At this point, we were disappointed that our intended dinner plans weren't panning out. And 
            we ended up being more bummed as we realized that none of the restaurants in Cuenca opened and 
            started serving food until 8pm. 
        </p>
        <p>Feeling much ire toward the Spanish food timetable, we ventured back to our Parador which 
            had a bar that served food all day. 
        </p>
        <p>Although we spent way more money than we usual do on a meal, we ended up having quite a fun 
            eating experience at the Parador bar. We got to sit at tables in the center of the converted 
            monastery (across from where they do dinner service at 8pm). After 
            looking at the bar menu, we picked some drinks and appetizers to share. 
        </p>
        <p>Dylan got a local craft beer that was apparently voted the best beer in the world not that 
            long ago. And I got a white wine that is produced only in this part of Spain.
        </p>
        <img src="dinner1.jpg">
        <p>An important side note: Cuenca is located in La Mancha, which is both the home of the character Don Quixote and the 
            home of Manchego cheese. Along with our drinks, we decided to order the cheese board along with a tomato salad 
            (Dylan is really nice to me) and a potted hare dish, which sounded weird but is a specialty of 
            the area.  
        </p>
        <img src="dinner2.jpg">
        <p>The food was incredibly tasty, but waaaaayyy too much food for two people. To our credit, we 
            tried to order the half portions of the tomatoes and potted hare, but the half got lost in 
            translation. Ultimately, though, it was the size of the cheese board that was truly comical. 
            It was clearly meant to be shared by 
            at least four but probably more like six people. 
        </p>
        <p>We refused to let the cheese board win...although maybe we should have. (Neither of us 
            feels like we need to eat any more manchego for quite some time).
        </p>
        <img src="dinner3.jpg">
        <p>With our bellies extremely full of cheese, we headed up to our hotel room to enjoy the sunset from our window.</p>

        <img src="night2.jpg">
        <p>Also, before going to bed, I decided to document this ridiculous feature of our bathroom. I'm 
            all for a window in the bathroom but not for a floor to ceiling window only one floor up 
            from the ground level where tourists are taking pictures - of the hotel!
